## About STEAMER

**[Steamer](https://bre-portfolio.fun)** is inspired by the popular digital games store _[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)_ by Valve corporation. It is created to demonstrate what have I learned so far when it comes to building using Laravel.

Steamer has 3 types of user:

* ### User
squidward@gmail.com pw:kredo1234
able to add balance into their wallet
able to purchase games within their balance
have access to their games library
ðŸš§WIPðŸš§ able to see news/publication from sellers

* ### Seller
larry@gmail.com pw:kredo1234
able to register product, and set the price(registered product needs admin approval before available to the users)
able to post news/publication
able to receive balance from users after a sale has been established

* ### Admin
plank@gmail.com pw:kredo1234
able to approve/reject products
able to manage users, changing their role/profile type, and activate/deactivate other users
able to add/edit/delete game categories

Feel free to come into the site and experience some CRUDs.

I plan to keep expanding this instead of building new project. A wise man once told me that its better to enhance one crap than creating more crap.

peace out!
