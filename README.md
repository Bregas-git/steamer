## <p align="center">About STEAMER</p>

[Êó•Êú¨Ë™ûREADME„ÅØ„Åì„Å°„Çâ](https://github.com/Bregas-git/steamer/blob/78f7b12940dae87cbe3fc9ca0424a29056453c3d/README-jp.md)

**[Steamer](https://bre-portfolio.fun)** is inspired by the popular digital games store _[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)_ by Valve corporation.

It is created to demonstrate what have I learned so far when it comes to building using Laravel.

Steamer has 3 types of user:

### User
- squidward@gmail.com pw:kredo1234
- able to add balance into their wallet
- able to purchase games within their balance
- have access to their games library
- üößWIPüöß able to see news/publication from sellers


### Seller
- larry@gmail.com pw:kredo1234
- able to register product, and set the price(registered product needs admin approval before available to the users)
- able to post news/publication
- able to receive balance from users after a sale has been established

### Admin
- plank@gmail.com pw:kredo1234
- able to approve/reject products
- able to manage users, changing their role/profile type, and activate/deactivate other users
- able to add/edit/delete game categories

I plan to keep expanding this instead of building new project. A wise man once told me that its better to enhance one crap than creating more crap.

There are still some errors in it too, I might need to test it using automation, and maybe do some API calls just to start experience new stuff.

Feel free to come into the site and experience some CRUDs.

peace out!
